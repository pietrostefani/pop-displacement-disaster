## Pre-Hackathon Meetings

Two pre-Hackathon meeting will take place online.

1.  Team Formation & Problem Selection: Participants meet their teammates and choose a problem statement to work on.
2.  Snowflake & Data Training: This session will cover:
    -   Where the data is located and how to access it
    -   Using Jupyter notebooks in Snowflake
    -   How to query, manipulate, and download data for local use if needed
    -   3–4 practical examples of data manipulation and visualisation tools in Snowflake

## What Groups should keep in mind

Participants will focus on triangulating key indicators of displacement and presenting their findings in clear, accessible formats that can inform both policymakers and humanitarian responders. The goal is to develop a compelling “Message + Infographic (Map or Other)”—a concise narrative supported by data visualisation —that can serve as a proof of concept for improving disaster response in future scenarios.

1.  **Infographic**: Most effective visualisations are usually a combination of images: maps + plots + icons, etc.

2.  **Code**: teams are *strongly encouraged* to submit any code developed during the Hackathon. This may include the creation of a GitHub repository to share scripts, data pipelines, or analysis workflows. Open and well-documented code will help ensure the solutions are reusable and scalable for future disaster response efforts. UoL may implement the proposed indicators into a software package and is eager to take the lead in developing this package as part of a collaborative effort.

This Hackathon offers an opportunity to contribute to tools and strategies that could significantly improve disaster response and resilience, not just in Pakistan but globally.

## Output to be submitted

Each group should prepare a short presentation (approximately 5 slides) to showcase their work at the end of the Hackathon. Emphasis should be placed on how effectively the findings are communicated. In addition, teams are *strongly encouraged* to submit any code developed during the Hackathon.
