# Snowflake {.unnumbered}

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/why-snowflake/) is a cloud-native data and AI platform that provides data warehousing and analytics. Its [architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05ZNHwvfsg) separates data storage from computing resources, allowing users to optimize costs by paying only for usage. This structure supports varied data applications, including data warehousing, data engineering, AI/ML modeling, fine-tuning, and inference. Snowflake operates across major public cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform), offering multi-cloud flexibility and streamlined data sharing.

Snowflake has many [programs and activities](https://www.snowflake.com/en/company/overview/snowflake-for-good/) aimed at community engagement and involvement. Data for Good is a key initiative within the European Marketing team, focused on mobilizing data to address global challenges. It supports non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and public sector bodies by offering access to Snowflake’s platform, resources, and data expertise. The program aims to empower these entities to harness data for social and environmental impact, contributing to solutions for issues like climate change, public health, and humanitarian efforts.

Within its social impact efforts, Snowflake has a new initiative called "[End Data Disparity](https://www.snowflake.com/en/company/overview/end-data-disparity/)." Disparity refers to lack of equal representation within datasets, and gaps in data access, analytics, and data collaboration. Snowflake’s objective in this area is to broaden data accessibility and literacy, enabling more communities and organizations, especially those that are underserved, to benefit from data-driven insights. By providing technology and support, Snowflake aims to help level the playing field, allowing these groups to use data to advocate for their needs, improve services, and foster equitable outcomes.

Through its platform architecture and dedicated social impact programs, Snowflake seeks to expand the reach and benefits of data analytics. By fostering data collaboration and aiming to reduce disparities in data access and capability, Snowflake seeks to enable both technological advancement and positive societal change.
