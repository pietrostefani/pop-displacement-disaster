# Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions

Code for the website of the hackathon for the project Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-Driven Framework Triangulating Data.
This project is led by Dr. Elisabetta Pietrostefani, Matt Mason and Prof. Francisco Rowe from the University of Liverpool.

Conducted in collaboration with the International Organization for Migrationâ€™s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and Snowflake Inc., this project explores innovative ways to estimate displacement in disaster-affected regions. It is funded by Research England.
