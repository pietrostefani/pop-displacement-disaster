# Case-study {.unnumbered}

The specific case study for this Hackathon will be the floods that struck Pakistan in 2022. Between June and October of that year, unprecedented monsoon rains affected over 33 million people across the country, resulting in 1,739 deaths and an estimated \$40 billion in property damage.

This event was selected for its large-scale humanitarian and economic impact, and the availability of high-quality data from both the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Meta. These datasets provide an opportunity for participants to compare, combine, and analyse real-world information in a meaningful way.

Focusing on a disaster aligns with the Hackathon’s broader goal: addressing challenges that are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change. Floods, in particular, represent a recurring threat in Pakistan, making this case both historically relevant and urgently contemporary and is one of the types of disaster events recording the greatest frequency worldwide.
