This website hosts the materials the final workshop & hackaton of Project: *Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-Driven Framework Triangulating Data* by Dr. Elisabetta Pietrostefani, Matt Mason and Prof. Francisco Rowe from the University of Liverpool. 

Conducted in collaboration with the International Organization for Migrationâ€™s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and Snowflake Inc., this project explores innovative ways to estimate displacement in disaster-affected regions. By comparing digital trace data with traditional data sources, it aims to develop a robust, policy-driven framework for triangulating and enhancing displacement estimates.
