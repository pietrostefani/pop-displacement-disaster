    "text": "The global challenge of internal displacement, exacerbated by conflict, climate-induced natural hazards and disasters, requires innovative and collaborative approaches to ensure effective responses. As of 2025, displacement continues to surge globally—with 3.7 million people uprooted within Ukraine due to conflict, 18.8 million internally displaced across the Horn of Africa from a mix of drought and violence, and millions more affected annually in South and Southeast Asia, where disasters like cyclones triggered at least 1.8 million displacements in 2023 alone. These figures are a stark reminder of the need for timely, accurate, and spatially detailed data and accessible ways to process it to inform humanitarian action and policy.\nThis project—led by the University of Liverpool, IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix and Snowflake Inc. —compares digital trace data with traditional sources to triangulate and improve displacement estimates.\nBy leveraging these diverse datasets, the project aims to enhance the precision and reliability of displacement estimates. Using Ukraine as an initial case study, this approach illustrates the ability to generate actionable insights in diverse and complex settings requiring rapid data insights, policy and humanitarian responses. During the hackathon, the framework will be applied to a real-world climate-induced hazard scenario—the Pakistan floods of August 2022—to support timely, data-driven disaster response efforts. This work has been developed in close partnership with operational agencies, ensuring its relevance to real-world needs and its potential to inform evidence-based decision-making.",

    "text": "Building on work by the University of Liverpool and IOM using digital data to track displacement in conflict settings, the Hackathon explores how similar approaches can be applied in the context of climate-induced natural hazards. In the aftermath of such disasters, understanding internal displacement patterns is vital for effective humanitarian response. While traditional survey-based methods, like those used by IOM, offer valuable insights in informing operational responses to mitigate the effect of disasters, they often take time to develop and be fully operational. Digital-trace data present opportunities for more timely, detailed, and dynamic tracking of population movements before and after climate events, to inform rapid response operations and support spatially targeted interventions.\nDuring the Hackathon, participants will utilise Meta’s “Facebook Movement During Crisis” and “Facebook Population During Crisis” data derived from mobile phone location records, alongside IOM’s displacement data. The Facebook Movement dataset records the movements of Facebook users, showing how people travel between different areas during a crisis. It includes both the typical movement patterns observed before the crisis and the actual movements during the event, allowing for a comparison between the two. The Population dataset includes information about the number of active Facebook users in a specific area during a crisis, the typical number of active users in that area before the crisis, and the difference between these two values. By integrating these datasets with traditional sources and socio-economic variables, teams will explore innovative approaches to enhance disaster response, optimise resource allocation, and develop predictive models for future crises.",

    "text": "The specific case study for this Hackathon will be the floods that struck Pakistan in 2022. Between June and October of that year, unprecedented monsoon rains affected over 33 million people across the country, resulting in 1,739 deaths and an estimated $40 billion in property damage.\nThis event was selected for its large-scale humanitarian and economic impact, and the availability of high-quality data from both the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Meta. These datasets provide an opportunity for participants to compare, combine, and analyse real-world information in a meaningful way.\nFocusing on a disaster aligns with the Hackathon’s broader goal: addressing challenges that are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change. Floods, in particular, represent a recurring threat in Pakistan, making this case both historically relevant and urgently contemporary and is one of the types of disaster events recording the greatest frequency worldwide.",

This may include the creation of a GitHub repository to share scripts, data pipelines, or analysis workflows. Open and well-documented code will help ensure the solutions are reusable and scalable for future disaster response efforts. UoL may implement the proposed indicators into a software package and is eager to take the lead in developing this package as part of a collaborative effort.\n\nThis Hackathon offers an opportunity to contribute to tools and strategies that could significantly improve disaster response and resilience, not just in Pakistan but globally.",

    "text": "2. Datasets\n\n2.1. Facebook Population and Movement During Crisis\n\nMeta provides these data as part of their Data for Good programme in the aftermath of humanitarian disasters. Once uploaded, these data are available to researchers and policymakers for 90 days before being removed from the Data for Good platform. The data shows the number of Facebook users located within a given spatial unit at a given time.\nFor the Hackathon, we are using the data available in the immediate aftermath of the 2022 Pakistan floods. The data refer to the period 14 August 2022 – 7 September 2022 and are at two geographic scales: 800m tiles and aggregated to administrative level 2 geographies.\nThese data consist of two datasets, Population During Crisis and Movement During Crisis:\n\nPopulation – these are population stock data, showing the number of users in each spatial unit at three snapshots: 00:00, 8:00 and 16:00 (Pacific Time). The data are removed when there are fewer than 10 observations.\nMovement – these are population flow data, showing the origin and destination of users between temporal points. Users’ origin and destination are chosen according to where they spent most time within each 8-hour window. For example, data recorded at 16:00 shows the flow between areas from 08:00 to 16:00. Where there are fewer than 10 observations for a flow, data are removed. The Pakistan data available for the Movement data are only at the 08:00 and 16:00 time periods, but not for the 00:00 period.\n\nThe data are generally comprehensive, but there are some gaps, largely due to collection issues at Meta’s end. For example, in both the tiled and aggregated Movement data, only the 08:00 and 16:00 time stamps are available, with the 00:00 period missing. Additionally, the aggregated Population data for 20, 21 and 22 August are also missing.\nBoth datasets contain data from a baseline period before the disaster event to compare users’ stock or flow during the crisis. The raw and percentage differences are provided within the dataset, along with a z-score to assess the statistical significance of the change from the pre-crisis baseline to the crisis period.\nThe data is available as a series of csv files. Each file is either the tiled or aggregated data for each time stamp of each day of the Population or Movement data.\n\nA guide on using these data in R can be found here.\n\n\n2.2. IOM Data\n\nThese data are collated and published by the IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) team. The primary data produced for Pakistan by the IOM in the context of the 2022 floods are the Flood Response Community Needs Identification (CNI) datasets. These data are collated and published in rounds; six rounds have been run so far, though data for Round 5 is not publicly available.\nData from the CNI is derived from key informant interviews and direct observations. It provides estimates for the number of temporarily displaced persons (TDPs), the number of returnees and other variables related to displaced populations for each village surveyed. A more detailed methodology for these data can be found in the reports below.\nFor the Hackathon, each data round is provided. The data format varies between rounds, though each generally provides similar variables and data.\nAlongside each round of data, a report is also published. Reports can be found here for each round:\n\nRound 1 (Nov – Dec 2022)\nRound 2 (Jan – Mar 2023)\nRound 3 – Balochistan Province (May – June 2023)\nRound 3 – Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (May – June 2023)\nRound 3 – Sindh Province (May – June 2023)\nRound 4 – Balochistan Province (August 2023)\nRound 4 – Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (August 2023)\nRound 4 – Sindh Province (August 2023)\nRound 6 – Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provinces (August 2024)\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Contextual Data\n\nAlongside mobility data, we have prepared a series of datasets that provide additional context to Pakistan. These data are:\n\nSpatial boundaries, sourced from GADM. The shapefile boundaries for administrative levels 0, 1, 2 and 3 and the geopackage for Pakistan are included.\nPopulation estimates for Pakistan from the 2020 Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). The data is in 100m resolution grids, cropped to Pakistan.\nPopulation estimates for Pakistan, aggregated to administrative levels 0, 1, 2, and 3. All but administrative level 3 data have variables for urban/rural and female/male/transgender populations. The data is sourced from the 2017 Pakistan Census, compiled by OCHA.\nDeprivation data from The Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDI). The data is a raster file at 1km resolution, cropped to Pakistan. Also available is a geopackage file for this measure, aggregated to Pakistan’s administrative level 2 geographies. Data are on a 0-100 scale, with high values indicating higher relative levels of deprivation. Complete documentation for the data can be accessed here.",
