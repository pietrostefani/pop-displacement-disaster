By comparing digital trace data with traditional data sources, it aims to develop a robust, policy-driven framework for triangulating and enhancing displacement estimates.\nThe website is free to use and is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International.",

    "text": "The global challenge of internal displacement, exacerbated by conflict, climate-induced natural hazards and disasters, requires innovative and collaborative approaches to ensure effective responses. As of 2025, displacement continues to surge globally—with 3.7 million people uprooted within Ukraine due to conflict, 18.8 million internally displaced across the Horn of Africa from a mix of drought and violence, and millions more affected annually in South and Southeast Asia, where disasters like cyclones triggered at least 1.8 million displacements in 2023 alone. These figures are a stark reminder of the need for timely, accurate, and spatially detailed data and accessible ways to process it to inform humanitarian action and policy.\nThis project—led by the University of Liverpool, IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix and Snowflake Inc. —compares digital trace data with traditional sources to triangulate and improve displacement estimates.\nBy leveraging these diverse datasets, the project aims to enhance the precision and reliability of displacement estimates. Using Ukraine as an initial case study, this approach illustrates the ability to generate actionable insights in diverse and complex settings requiring rapid data insights, policy and humanitarian responses. During the hackathon, the framework will be applied to a real-world climate-induced hazard scenario—the Pakistan floods of August 2022—to support timely, data-driven disaster response efforts. This work has been developed in close partnership with operational agencies, ensuring its relevance to real-world needs and its potential to inform evidence-based decision-making.",

    "text": "Building on work by the University of Liverpool and IOM using digital data to track displacement in conflict settings, the Hackathon explores how similar approaches can be applied in the context of climate-induced natural hazards. In the aftermath of such disasters, understanding internal displacement patterns is vital for effective humanitarian response. While traditional survey-based methods, like those used by IOM, offer valuable insights in informing operational responses to mitigate the effect of disasters, they often take time to develop and be fully operational. Digital-trace data present opportunities for more timely, detailed, and dynamic tracking of population movements before and after climate events, to inform rapid response operations and support spatially targeted interventions.\nDuring the Hackathon, participants will utilise Meta’s “Facebook Movement During Crisis” and “Facebook Population During Crisis” data derived from mobile phone location records, alongside IOM’s displacement data. The Facebook Movement dataset records the movements of Facebook users, showing how people travel between different areas during a crisis. It includes both the typical movement patterns observed before the crisis and the actual movements during the event, allowing for a comparison between the two. The Population dataset includes information about the number of active Facebook users in a specific area during a crisis, the typical number of active users in that area before the crisis, and the difference between these two values. By integrating these datasets with traditional sources and socio-economic variables, teams will explore innovative approaches to enhance disaster response, optimise resource allocation, and develop predictive models for future crises.",

    "text": "The specific case study for this Hackathon will be the floods that struck Pakistan in 2022. Between June and October of that year, unprecedented monsoon rains affected over 33 million people across the country, resulting in 1,739 deaths and an estimated $40 billion in property damage.\nThis event was selected for its large-scale humanitarian and economic impact, and the availability of high-quality data from both the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Meta. These datasets provide an opportunity for participants to compare, combine, and analyse real-world information in a meaningful way.\nFocusing on a disaster aligns with the Hackathon’s broader goal: addressing challenges that are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change. Floods, in particular, represent a recurring threat in Pakistan, making this case both historically relevant and urgently contemporary and is one of the types of disaster events recording the greatest frequency worldwide.",

This may include the creation of a GitHub repository to share scripts, data pipelines, or analysis workflows. Open and well-documented code will help ensure the solutions are reusable and scalable for future disaster response efforts. UoL may implement the proposed indicators into a software package and is eager to take the lead in developing this package as part of a collaborative effort.\n\nThis Hackathon offers an opportunity to contribute to tools and strategies that could significantly improve disaster response and resilience, not just in Pakistan but globally.",
